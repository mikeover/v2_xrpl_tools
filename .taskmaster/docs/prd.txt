# Overview
The XRP Ledger NFT Activity Monitoring System is a comprehensive real-time monitoring and alerting platform designed to track NFT-related activities on the XRP Ledger. It serves NFT collectors, traders, and enthusiasts who need instant notifications about mints, sales, and listings based on their specific interests. The system provides value by enabling users to never miss important NFT events, make informed trading decisions, and stay ahead in the fast-paced NFT market.

# Core Features

## Real-time Transaction Monitoring
- Monitors all XRPL transactions as they're confirmed on the ledger
- Identifies and classifies NFT-specific activities (mints, sales, offers, burns)
- Maintains persistent connections to multiple XRPL nodes for reliability
- Automatically detects and recovers from ledger gaps to ensure no transactions are missed

## NFT Metadata and Image Management
- Fetches metadata from IPFS, HTTP, and Arweave sources
- Downloads and processes NFT images with automatic optimization
- Caches all data in S3 with CDN distribution for fast access
- Supports retroactive metadata fetching for existing NFTs

## User Alert Configuration System
- Allows users to create custom alerts based on collections (issuer + taxon)
- Supports complex trait-based filtering with AND/OR logic
- Price range filtering for sales and offers
- Activity type filtering (mints, sales, offers)
- Multiple notification channels per alert

## Multi-channel Notification Delivery
- Discord integration with rich embeds
- Email notifications with customizable templates
- Webhook support for custom integrations
- Real-time WebSocket notifications for web/mobile apps
- Rate limiting to prevent spam

## Analytics and Insights
- Collection-level statistics and trends
- User activity dashboards
- NFT price history tracking
- Market activity reports

# User Experience

## User Personas

### NFT Collector
- Wants to track specific collections they're interested in
- Needs instant notifications for new mints and rare traits
- Values accurate metadata and high-quality images

### NFT Trader
- Requires real-time alerts for market opportunities
- Needs price-based filtering for profit opportunities
- Wants comprehensive activity history

### Collection Creator
- Monitors their own collection's activity
- Tracks secondary market sales
- Analyzes buyer behavior and trends

## Key User Flows

### Alert Setup Flow
1. User connects wallet or creates account
2. Searches for collections by name or issuer
3. Configures alert criteria (traits, price, activity types)
4. Selects notification channels
5. Receives test notification to confirm setup

### Notification Flow
1. System detects matching NFT activity
2. Enriches event with metadata and images
3. Formats notification based on channel requirements
4. Delivers notification with retry logic
5. Tracks delivery status and user engagement

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, intuitive interface for alert configuration
- Real-time activity feed with filtering options
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go monitoring
- Dark mode support for extended viewing
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

- Admin API for system management

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Compute
- Auto-scaling container clusters
- GPU instances for image processing
- High-memory instances for caching

### Storage
- 10TB+ S3 storage for images/metadata
- 1TB+ PostgreSQL cluster
- 100GB+ Redis cluster

### Network
- CloudFront CDN for global distribution
- Load balancers with SSL termination
- VPC with private subnets
